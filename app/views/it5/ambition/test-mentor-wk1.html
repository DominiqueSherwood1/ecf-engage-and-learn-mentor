      Contracting is most effective when both parties (yourself and the ECT) answer questions for each other. </p>

        Context-specific meeting
      </h2>
      <p>In addition to contracting, as required, you may wish to
        meet with your teacher to work through any contextspecific policies, systems and/or procedures that they
        will need to know about to be effective in their role. It is
        also important for teachers to be made aware of schoolspecific policies so you may wish to point your NQT to
        these and provide some time to discuss them. </p>
      <p>Typical school policies include, but are not limited to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Their responsibilities planning.</li>
        <li>The schoolâ€™s behaviour policy.</li>
          <li>The safeguarding procedures.</li>
          <li>How your school assesses pupils.</li>
          <li>Your marking requirements.</li>
      </ul>
