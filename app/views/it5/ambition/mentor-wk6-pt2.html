    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      During the observation
    </h3>

    <p>Consider the following questions based on a short (approximately 15 minute) observation of your teacher:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>What was your teacher’s <strong>previous target</strong>? Are they meeting it? How do you know?</li>
      <li>For the <strong>development area</strong> you are focussing on for this observation, what is your teacher already doing well?</li>
      </ul>

<p>Next, select a <a href="/dev/ambition/mentor-wk3-pt2">focused development area</a> to further zoom in on. Then select
<a href="/dev/ambition/mentor-wk3-pt2">(from the examples)</a> or write one precise target (bite-sized action) to coach your teacher on. You can choose to
stick with the previous target if your teacher have not made enough progress yet</p>

<p>How will you model the target to your teacher to show them what good looks like?</p>

<p>What questions will you ask to check your teacher understands the model? For example, ‘How it is different from your current
practice?’, ‘What impact might it have on your practice and pupils?’, ‘What links can you see between the model
and the module principles (below)?’</p>

  <p>Reminder: Your model should help your teacher develop their ability in some of the following:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Use consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.</li>
    <li>Give manageable, specific and sequential instructions.</li>
    <li>Make the steps in a process memorable and ensure pupils can recall them.</li>
    <li>Deliver instructions using appropriate volume and tone of voice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      After the observation
    </h3>

    <p>Next, meet with your teacher to work through the ‘Feedback’ stage of instructional coaching.</p>
