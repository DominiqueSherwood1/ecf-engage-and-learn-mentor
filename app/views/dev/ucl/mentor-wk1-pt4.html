  Review: 15 minutes
</h3>

<p>Possible topics for discussion are:</p>


  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>where and when will weekly sessions happen? This includes your mentee’s self-directed study as well as your mentor meetings.</li>
  <li>how will you keep these sessions separate from statutory NQT induction activities, bearing in mind that the Early Career Framework is a support framework and not an assessment framework?</li>
  <li>how will you work together in sessions? What are your preferred ways of working? What do you each find most enjoyable/challenging, for example?</li>
  <li>how will you resolve any difficulties that arise over the year?</li>
  <li>what are you each most looking forward to about working together on this programme?</li>
  <li>will your mentee keep a record of the meetings and, if so, how? You may want to consider using a Learning Log, as outlined in the programme handbook</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
    Plan and Theory to Practice: 40 mins
  </h3>

<p>Ask your mentee to work through the <a href="https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ucl/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/01_Module-1-Audit.pdf">Module 1 audit</a> and to self-assess against each criterion. They should base their judgement on their current knowledge
and/or practice. Some suggested definitions to support this assessment are offered below. All should be interpreted in relation to the mentee’s context and what can reasonably be expected of an early-career teacher who has just
completed initial teacher education.</p>

<p><strong>Emerging:</strong> I don’t feel very confident in this area. I have substantial gaps in my knowledge and/or practice which definitely need to be addressed.</p>

<p><strong>Developing:</strong> I have some knowledge about this, and/or there is evidence in my practice that I do this some of the time or to some extent. I am in a position to build on this with further work in this area.</p>

<p><strong>Secure:</strong> I know a lot about this, and/or I do it in my practice consistently and well.</p>
