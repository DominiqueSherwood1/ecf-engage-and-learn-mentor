  <p class= "govuk-!-margin-top-7">There are no new materials in Year 2.</p>

<p>ECTs should use the second year to revisit any topics from the first year they think need further development.</p>

<p>We recommend you regularly catch up with them to reflect on what theyâ€™ve learnt, discuss any issues or concerns, and decide what actions to take going forward.</p>
