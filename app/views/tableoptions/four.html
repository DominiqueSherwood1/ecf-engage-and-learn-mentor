    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Reflecting on learning (10 minutes)
    </h3>

    <p>Revisit the ECT’s top five behavioural expectations from the previous session. Ask them: </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>How have you communicated them?</li>
      <li>How have you practised them?</li>
      <li>How have you reinforced them?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Are these behavioural expectations being met in all of their lessons? If the ECT says yes, ask them to talk
      through the evidence of this. If no (which is probably more likely at this stage) ask them which ones are the
      key issues.</p>

    <p>Pose the question: <strong>What actions are you taking to influence these behaviours?</strong></p>

    <p>Go over the impact a positive climate for learning can have on behaviour and explain that this session is all
      about thinking about establishing some of the things that make up the climate for learning in the classroom.
      In particular focus on the class/es that the ECT is finding the trickiest</p>

    <p>The mentor may want to cover:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Building, maintaining and fixing relationships with pupils</li>
      <li>Developing effective routines</li>
      <li>Maintaining high expectations of pupils’ behaviour and learning.</li>
    </ul>



    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Identifying problem areas (10 minutes)
    </h3>

    <p>not important to add content now</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Improving behaviour (30 minutes)
    </h3>

    <p>Take a look at the example action plan on <a href="https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Block-1-mentor-handout-1.4.pdf">Handout 1.4</a>. The teacher has identified a key issue and then used
      the table below to plan out action steps. </p>

    <p>From the area identified in the last activity, use the content below to select an action step. Together, use the template
      to write an action plan to help the ECT’s class.</p>
