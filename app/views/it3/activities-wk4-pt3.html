      Discuss next week's observation
    </h4>

    <p>Module 1 has introduced a range of approaches to behaviour management, many of which your mentee will now have put into practice.</p>

    <p>As part of next week’s ECT mentor meeting, you will observe your mentee using some of these approaches.</p>

    <p>Based on your mentee’s development needs and the challenges they are currently experiencing with their pupils, agree with your mentee which class you will observe
      and the focus of this observation.</p>
    <p>The observation is allocated 20 minutes of your meeting time for the week.</p>

    <p>Use the notes made by your mentee in their self-study session and the outcomes of
      the first activity in this session as a starting point for some collaborative planning.</p>

    <p>Work with your mentee to plan how they will incorporate into their teaching, in the
      coming week, strategies for developing pupils’ resilience, self-regulation and
      motivation. </p>

    <div
    <div style="background-color:#F3F2F1; padding: 16px;">
      <p>Agree with your mentee:</p>

        <li>the success criteria for this observation, contextualised for your
          mentee’s stage of development and the characteristics of their pupils</li>

  processes."

  Collaborative planning
</h4>

<p>Spend some time with your mentee planning their lesson for the agreed observation
  next week. Make use of research and practice summaries from previous weeks in
  this module, as appropriate, to stimulate ideas for the lesson. You might also use
  scripting and/or rehearsal if this suits your mentee’s needs.</p>
