  Introduction
</h3>
<p>In their first self-study session of this module, your mentee considered how they can
be a role model to their pupils. They also learnt about the importance of setting clear
expectations, and about how to embed routines to support an effective learning
environment. They have spent some time exploring the culture and values of your
school and observed a colleague beginning their lesson. They then drafted a script
for an entry routine to their classroom â€“ you will work on this together during this ECT
mentor meeting. </p>
