      Hi Joe,
    </p>
    <p>
      You can now access an online service designed to make your role as a teaching mentor easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have replaced the one-year newly qualified teacher (NQT) induction with a new 2-year coaching and mentoring programme.
      This will give teachers all the tools they need to thrive in their new role.
    </p>
    <p>
      The programme has been developed by teachers, school leaders, education experts and the Department for Education.
      It’s broken down into weekly topics aligned to the
      <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/665520/Teachers__Standards.pdf">teachers’ standards</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service gives you access to handy overviews of all the weekly topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll be able to check the progress of teachers you’re coaching and mentoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can record weekly lesson feedback in your account. These can also be shared with their induction tutors for performance reviews.
