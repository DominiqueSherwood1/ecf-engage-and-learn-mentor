      Analyse artefacts/discuss with teacher
    </h3>

    <p>Invite your mentee to talk you through the vignettes and checklist they drafted in their
      self-study session this week and to share what they learned from completing these
      activities. Use your knowledge and experience to highlight strengths in your
      mentee’s reflective thinking and suggest ways to make the most of their learning
      from the activities as they put their checklist into practice.</p>

    <p>To support this discussion, you could:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>connect your mentee’s checklist to your school’s behaviour policy to
        ensure that the two are aligned</li>
      <li>highlight strengths in your mentee’s current approach to managing
        behaviour on which they can build</li>
      <li>note any areas for development which your mentee has not included
        in their checklist, but which you think should usefully be addressed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Discuss with mentor
    </h3>

    <p>Module 1 has introduced a range of approaches to behaviour management, many of which your mentee will now have put into practice.</p>

    <p>As part of next week’s ECT mentor meeting, you will observe your mentee using some of these approaches.</p>

    <p>Based on your mentee’s development needs and the challenges they are currently experiencing with their pupils, agree with your mentee which class you will observe
      and the focus of this observation.</p>
    <p>The observation is allocated 20 minutes of your meeting time for the week.</p>

    <p>Use the notes made by your mentee in their self-study session and the outcomes of
      the first activity in this session as a starting point for some collaborative planning.</p>

    <p>Work with your mentee to plan how they will incorporate into their teaching, in the
      coming week, strategies for developing pupils’ resilience, self-regulation and
      motivation. </p>

    <div <div style="background-color:#F3F2F1; padding: 16px;">
      <p>Agree with your mentee:</p>

        <li>the success criteria for this observation, contextualised for your
          mentee’s stage of development and the characteristics of their pupils</li>

      Collaborative planning
    </h3>

    <p>Spend some time with your mentee planning their lesson for the agreed observation
      next week. Make use of research and practice summaries from previous weeks in
      this module, as appropriate, to stimulate ideas for the lesson. You might also use
      scripting and/or rehearsal if this suits your mentee’s needs.</p>
