    <p>Hi [Add first name],</p>

    <p>
      Your school has created a GOV.UK account so you can access materials to use while mentoring early career teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They’ve been designed to compliment the self-study materials the teachers will use during their 2-year induction programme.
    </p>

    <p>
      To sign in to your account, go to the <a href="/it4/sign-in">Mentoring for early career teachers</a> service on GOV.UK.</p>
    <p>
      You will need the email address your school used when they created your account. This will probably be your work email.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks,<br>
      The mentoring for early careers teachers team
    </p>
